# LlamaIndex RAG Techniques

> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**: This repository is actively under development. New techniques, implementations, and documentation are being added regularly.

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) techniques, with a focus on practical implementations using LlamaIndex. Each technique is thoroughly documented with both theoretical explanations and working code examples.

## Currently Implemented Techniques

### âœ… Vector Store Index
- Complete implementation and documentation
- Best practices and optimization strategies
- Performance considerations
- [Documentation](docs/vector-store-index.md)
- [Implementation](src/vector_store_index.py)

### âœ… Reranking
- Multiple reranking strategies
- Integration patterns
- Performance optimization
- [Documentation](docs/reranking.md)
- [Implementation](src/reranking.py)

### âœ… Deep Memory
- Training process implementation
- Integration with vector stores
- Performance optimization guides
- [Documentation](docs/deep-memory.md)
- [Implementation](src/deep_memory.py)

## Coming Soon

### ðŸ”„ In Development
- Hybrid Search Techniques
