## Quick Start (3 minutes)

### Installation & Setup
```bash
pip install llama-index llama-index-vector-stores-deeplake llama-index-postprocessor-cohere-rerank cohere
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.Advanced_RAG_tenchniques_LLamaIndex import AdvancedRAGEngine

# Initialize the engine
rag_engine = AdvancedRAGEngine(
    documents_path="./your_documents",
    openai_api_key="your_openai_key",
    activeloop_token="your_activeloop_token",
    cohere_api_key="your_cohere_key"
)

# Process queries with different techniques
response = rag_engine.process_query("Your question here", engine_type="basic")
print(response)
```

## Module Overview

The implementation provides these core components:

### AdvancedRAGEngine Class
- **Primary Interface**: Main class for all advanced RAG operations
- **Methods**: `process_query()`, `basic_query_engine()`, `reranking_query_engine()`, `sub_question_query_engine()`
- **Configuration**: Supports chunk size, overlap, similarity thresholds, and API keys

### Key Features
1. **Multiple Query Engine Types**: Basic, reranking, and sub-question engines
2. **Vector Store Integration**: DeepLake for scalable vector storage  
3. **Advanced Retrieval**: Cohere reranking and sub-question decomposition
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable parameters for different use cases

## Query Construction
### Core Concept
Query construction transforms natural language queries into structured formats optimized for different data sources. It bridges the gap between user intent and database query languages.

### Implementation in Code
The `AdvancedRAGEngine.process_query()` method handles query construction internally:

```python
# Basic query construction and processing
response = rag_engine.process_query(
    "What are the key insights from the document?",
    engine_type="basic",
    similarity_top_k=10
)
```

### Implementation Details
- **Vector Format Translation**: Handled by the underlying VectorStoreIndex
- **Structured Query Generation**: Integrated with DeepLake vector store
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines semantic search with metadata filtering
  
### Key Components
1. **VectorStoreIndex**: Core indexing for semantic search (line 91-94)
2. **DeepLake Integration**: Scalable vector storage with metadata support (line 81-84)
3. **Query Processing Pipeline**: Unified interface via `process_query()` method (line 177-204)

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Hallucination Prevention**: Use accurate document chunking and overlap settings
- **Query Accuracy**: Configurable similarity thresholds and top-k retrieval
- **Error Handling**: Built-in validation in `process_query()` method

## Query Expansion
### Core Concept
Extends original queries with related terms or synonyms to broaden search scope and improve result relevance.

### Implementation in Code
Query expansion is handled through the vector store's similarity search and configurable retrieval parameters:

```python
# Expand search scope with higher similarity threshold
response = rag_engine.process_query(
    "climate change effects",
    engine_type="basic",
    similarity_top_k=20  # Retrieve more documents for broader context
)
```

### Implementation Approach
- **Semantic Expansion**: Vector embeddings naturally capture related concepts
- **Configurable Scope**: Adjust `similarity_top_k` for broader or narrower retrieval
- **Context Integration**: Chunk overlap settings preserve contextual relationships

### Example
Original query: "climate change effects"
The system automatically finds semantically related content covering:
- "global warming impact"
- "environmental consequences" 
- "temperature rise implications"

## Query Transformation
### Core Concept
Modifies query structure and content to optimize retrieval effectiveness while maintaining semantic intent.

### Implementation in Code
Query transformation occurs through the sub-question engine for complex queries:

```python
# Transform complex queries into sub-questions
complex_query = "Compare climate policies and their economic impact"
response = rag_engine.process_query(
    complex_query,
    engine_type="sub_question"
)
```

### Implementation Strategy
- **Sub-Question Decomposition**: `SubQuestionQueryEngine` breaks complex queries (line 141-175)
- **Contextual Processing**: Each sub-question processed independently
- **Response Synthesis**: Combines results while maintaining semantic coherence

### Example
Original: "What were Microsoft's revenues in 2021 and how do they compare to competitors?"
Transformed into sub-questions:
1. "Microsoft revenues 2021"
2. "Competitor revenues 2021"
3. "Revenue comparison analysis"

## Query Engine Types
### Basic Query Engine
**Implementation**: `AdvancedRAGEngine.basic_query_engine()` (line 96-114)

```python
# Create and use basic query engine
basic_engine = rag_engine.basic_query_engine(
    similarity_top_k=10,
    streaming=True
)
response = basic_engine.query("Your question")
```

Features:
- Processes single queries directly
- Configurable similarity thresholds 
- Optional response streaming
- Built on VectorStoreIndex

### Sub Question Query Engine
**Implementation**: `AdvancedRAGEngine.sub_question_query_engine()` (line 141-175)

```python
# Handle complex queries with sub-question decomposition
response = rag_engine.process_query(
    "Analyze the relationship between economic factors and climate policies",
    engine_type="sub_question"
)
```

#### Features
- Automatically breaks complex queries into manageable sub-questions
- Processes each sub-question independently using the base query engine
- Synthesizes comprehensive final response
- Supports asynchronous processing for better performance

#### Implementation Requirements (Already Built-in)
1. ✅ Base query engine configured automatically
2. ✅ QueryEngineTool registration handled in constructor
3. ✅ SubQuestionQueryEngine initialization with metadata
4. ✅ Async processing enabled by default

## Advanced Retrieval Techniques

### Reranking with Cohere
**Implementation**: `AdvancedRAGEngine.reranking_query_engine()` (line 116-139)

```python
# Use Cohere reranking for improved relevance
response = rag_engine.process_query(
    "Find the most relevant sections about AI applications",
    engine_type="rerank",
    similarity_top_k=20,  # Initial broad retrieval
    rerank_top_n=3       # Keep top 3 after reranking
)
```

#### Core Concept
Re-evaluates and re-orders search results to improve relevance scoring using Cohere's advanced language understanding.

#### Implementation Details
- **Cohere Integration**: Uses `CohereRerank` postprocessor (line 131-134)
- **Two-Stage Process**: Initial retrieval followed by intelligent reranking
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles multiple documents
- **Score Assignment**: Advanced relevance scoring based on query context

#### Configuration
- ✅ API key management built-in
- ✅ Customizable `similarity_top_k` for initial retrieval
- ✅ Configurable `rerank_top_n` for final selection
- ✅ Automatic integration with query pipeline

### Recursive Retrieval
#### Core Concept
Navigates hierarchical document structures to form relationships between nodes.

#### Implementation in Code
The system supports recursive retrieval through the document processing pipeline:

```python
# Document processing with hierarchical awareness
rag_engine = AdvancedRAGEngine(
    documents_path="./hierarchical_docs",
    chunk_size=512,      # Balanced chunk size
    chunk_overlap=64     # Preserve context across chunks
)
```

#### Use Cases
- PDFs with nested content and sections
- Documents with tables, diagrams, and references
- Cross-referenced materials with internal links

### Small-to-Big Retrieval  
#### Core Concept
Progressive retrieval strategy starting with focused chunks and expanding context through overlap settings.

#### Implementation Details
The implementation handles this through intelligent chunking and overlap:

```python
# Configure for small-to-big retrieval pattern
rag_engine = AdvancedRAGEngine(
    documents_path="./documents",
    chunk_size=256,      # Smaller initial chunks
    chunk_overlap=128    # Significant overlap for context expansion
)
```

#### Benefits
- **Improved Context**: Overlap settings maintain contextual relationships (line 57-58)
- **Flexible Retrieval**: Configurable chunk sizes for different content types
- **Better Relationships**: Node parsing preserves document structure (line 59-63)
- **Accurate Responses**: Context preservation leads to more relevant results

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Implementation-Specific Optimizations
Based on the `AdvancedRAGEngine` configuration options:

```python
# Optimized configuration for performance
rag_engine = AdvancedRAGEngine(
    documents_path="./documents",
    chunk_size=512,      # Balanced for context vs speed
    chunk_overlap=64,    # Minimal overlap for efficiency
)

# Use streaming for better user experience
basic_engine = rag_engine.basic_query_engine(
    similarity_top_k=5,  # Lower k for faster responses
    streaming=True       # Enable streaming responses
)
```

### General Guidelines
1. **Vector Store Caching**: DeepLake provides built-in caching (line 81-84)
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple queries efficiently through single engine instance
3. **Index Optimization**: Configure appropriate chunk sizes based on document types

### Configuration Recommendations
1. **Chunk Size**: Use constructor parameters (line 37-38)
   - Small docs: 256-512 tokens
   - Large docs: 512-1024 tokens
2. **Overlap**: Balance context vs performance (line 38)
   - Minimal: 32-64 tokens
   - Rich context: 128+ tokens  
3. **Top-k**: Adjust per query type
   - Simple queries: 3-5 documents
   - Complex queries: 10-20 documents

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Implementation-Based Solutions
1. **Over-retrieval**: Use reranking to focus on most relevant results
   ```python
   # Solution: Use reranking to reduce noise
   response = rag_engine.process_query(query, engine_type="rerank", rerank_top_n=3)
   ```

2. **Insufficient Context**: Increase overlap or use sub-question engine
   ```python
   # Solution: Sub-question engine for better context
   response = rag_engine.process_query(complex_query, engine_type="sub_question")
   ```

3. **API Rate Limits**: Built-in error handling in `process_query()` method
4. **Memory Issues**: Configurable chunk sizes and streaming support

## Best Practices

### Code-Level Best Practices
1. **Engine Reuse**: Initialize once, query multiple times
   ```python
   # Good: Reuse engine instance
   rag_engine = AdvancedRAGEngine(...)
   for query in queries:
       response = rag_engine.process_query(query)
   ```

2. **Parameter Tuning**: Use the flexible configuration system
3. **Error Handling**: Leverage built-in validation (line 200-201)  
4. **Monitoring**: Track query performance and adjust parameters
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep embeddings and indices current

## Integration Considerations

### Production Deployment
```python
# Production-ready configuration
rag_engine = AdvancedRAGEngine(
    documents_path=os.environ['DOCS_PATH'],
    openai_api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'],
    activeloop_token=os.environ['ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN'], 
    cohere_api_key=os.environ['COHERE_API_KEY'],
    chunk_size=int(os.environ.get('CHUNK_SIZE', 512)),
    chunk_overlap=int(os.environ.get('CHUNK_OVERLAP', 64))
)
```

### Key Considerations
1. **API Management**: Environment variable configuration supported
2. **Resource Utilization**: Configurable parameters for different environments
3. **Scalability**: DeepLake vector store scales horizontally
4. **Error Handling**: Built-in validation and error management
5. **Monitoring**: Easy to add logging around `process_query()` calls
